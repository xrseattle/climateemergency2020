          <h2>Indigenous People Demand Declaration of Climate Emergency</h2>

          <p>
          It’s 2020. We’ve entered the last decade in which to take effective action to avert the worst possible climate catastrophes. Indigenous leaders are holding state and local governments accountable to tell the truth:  we are in a climate emergency.  “Our children, their children, all children, deserve a future free of the threat of climate disaster and toxic water,” says Saanich activist Paul Chiyokten Wagner, “It’s their birthright. All of the creations of the Creator deserve a livable planet and it is our human responsibility to protect the circle of life while there is still time."
          </p>

          <p>
          The time for incremental change has come and gone. Our work now is to force climate emergency to the center of political action. In Washington State, Protectors of the Salish Sea, an action organization founded by Chiyokten, is leading the campaign to enact state government emergency measures since their 46-mile prayer walk and occupation of the state capitol grounds in 2019. 
          </p>

          <p>
          While  over a thousand  local governments worldwide have declared a climate emergency or enacted resolutions for a Green New Deal, there are many more that have not, and a single state government has yet to do so.
          </p>

          <p>
          It is for these reasons, and many others, that we call on indigenous protectors of the sacred and all of our allies, wherever you are, to bring the demand for a declaration of climate emergency to the seat of your state or local government with bold, direct actions. A government that declares climate emergency is facing the truth and putting the well-being of its people first.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          <strong>The minimum emergency actions are</strong>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Place a moratorium on permits for new fossil fuel projects</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Impanel a citizens assembly to define policies that support the needs of the residents of the locality or state</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
